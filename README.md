# MAP671-Final-Project
This project synthesized a variety of tools, techniques, and methods throughtout MAP671. Key lessons learned include:
Creating a process to export Google location data from my Google account into a usable format for mapping. This involved:
    <ul>
        <li>Exporting data from the location history from Google. Because Google allows only exporting in monthly time frames, I had to export each day for the time frame that I wanted as a .KML file.</li>
        <li>Upon exporting each day's data, I then uploaded that data to Geojson.io where I was able to see and verify all point locations.</li>
        <li>Next, I was able to export all 15 days of individual .KML files as one geojson file which was then uploaded to Mapbox.</li>
        <li>Two duplicate files were made of this dataset to show a line segment of my travel route and a second to show point locations</li>
        <li>These two datasets were then style with color and size to create a visually appealing map feature.</li>
    </ul>

Working with numberous CSS and HTML refinements to create a visually and interactively pleasing map. Specific elements that I explored and used include:
    <ul>
    <li>Resizing large (both in pixels and megabytes) photos</li>
    <li>Placment of photos within a two column web page</li>
    <li>Including a Mapbox map within my web page</li>
    <li>Creating hyperlinks for provide readers a convenient way to gain additional information on the location or site that was visited.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Style datasets in Mapbox for point locations, line segments, and feature labels.</li>
<li>A seperate geojson file needed to be created of a smaller set of locations to visualize to highligh key areas or locations that would also help to provide reference on the map.</li>
<li>Utilize a technology and software flow the included Bracets as my text editor, GitHub to store my data in repositories and serve as a version control</li>
</ul>

# MAP671-Final-Project
This project synthesized a variety of tools, techniques, and methods throughtout MAP671. Key lessons learned include:
Creating a process to export Google location data from my Google account into a usable format for mapping. This involved:
    <ul>
        <li>Exporting data from the location history from Google. Because Google allows only exporting in monthly time frames, I had to export each day for the time frame that I wanted as a .KML file.</li>
        <li>Upon exporting each day's data, I then uploaded that data to Geojson.io where I was able to see and verify all point locations.</li>
        <li>Next, I was able to export all 15 days of individual .KML files as one geojson file which was then uploaded to Mapbox.</li>
        <li></li>
        <li></li>
    </ul>
    
Style datasets in Mapbox for point locations, line segments, and feature labels.
A seperate geojson file needed to be created of a smaller set of locations to visualize to highligh key areas or locations that would also help to provide reference on the map.
Working with numberous CSS and HTML refinements to create a pleasing layout. Specific elements that I explored and used include:
    <ul>
    <ul>1).Resizing large (both in pixels and megabytes) photos</ul>
    <ul>2).Placment of photos within a two column web page</ul>
    <ul>3).Including a Mapbox map within my web page</ul>
    <ul>4).Creating hyperlinks for provide readers a convenient way to gain additional information on the location or site that was visited.</ul>
</ul>
